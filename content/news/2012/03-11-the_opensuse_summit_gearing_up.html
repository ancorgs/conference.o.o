<h1>The openSUSE Summit gearing up!</h1>

<p>2012 marks the first year that we are holding a conference in the Americas region.
With the growth of the global openSUSE community the need for a 'cousin' to the successful European openSUSE conference in the Americas has risen. 
Co-located with SUSECon, the main conference of our biggest sponsor, SUSE Linux, The openSUSE Summit will bring together the North- Central 
and South American community to meet face to face and collaborate on all things Open Source and openSUSE. 

<h2>Call for Presentations</h2>
<p>Like all openSUSE events, the Summit aims to bolster the 'open' in openSUSE, bringing together openSUSE 
contributors and members of numerous other Open Source projects, including upstream projects like LibreOffice, 
Samba and GNOME as well as from other distributions like Fedora and Debian. This will create a rich environment 
for innovation, a place where ideas become reality!</p>

<p>A Paper Committee has been assembled and is soliciting proposals for talks, workshops and presentations on a wide range of subjects.
  If you know about Packaging and the tools around it, are involved in core Linux infrastructure like kernel or userland tooling, 
  hack on GNOME or KDE, are an experienced sysadmin or otherwise have something interesting to bring to the conference, go and 
  read up on what they're looking for! </p>

<h2>Sign up to be there!</h2>

<p>We expect to welcome about 200 Open Source developers, testers, usability experts, artists and professional attendees. 
  Admission to the openSUSE conference is free. However a professional attendee ticket is available that offers some additional benefits.</p>

<h2> About openSUSE </h2>
