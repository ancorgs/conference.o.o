<h1>Overview of What Happened</h1>
<p>In the last few weeks, the conference team has worked hard to prepare the conference. The main news items you should be awere of are the FAQ which has been published, the party locations and times, the call to organize BoF sessions and of course the sponsors who help make the event possible. And we're happy to tell you that we will provide live video streams from the main rooms during the event (!!!) and we announced the Round Table sessions during the Future Media track. Last but not least, there have been some interviews with interesting speakers in the schedule!</p>

<h2>Sneak Peek of the Conference Schedule</h2>
<p>Let's start with the interviews. During the last weeks, a number of interesting speakers has been interviewed, both by text and over video chat. You can find the interviews in our <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/10/08/first-opensuse-conference-sneak-peek/">first sneak peek article</a> and more in <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/10/11/learn-more-about-open-next-week-in-prague/">this extensive follow-up article about the Future Media track</a>. You can find the video interviews also in our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/opensusetv">youtube channel</a> and on our <a href="http://blip.tv/opensuse">blip.tv channel</a>. One teaser interview below!</p>

<h2>Video!</h2>
<p>Talking about video interviews, there will be more videos in those channels: the openSUSE Video team is <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_video">gearing up to tape the talks</a> at the event. They will even provide a <em>live stream</em> of the event, which you can watch via flash and on a smartphone at <a href="http://bambuser.com/channel/opensusetv" rel="nofollow">bambuser</a> and via these three links via ogv feeds:<a href="http://stream.masterssystems.com:8000/opensuse1.ogv" rel="nofollow">Room Kirk</a> <a href="http://stream.masterssystems.com:8000/opensuse2.ogv" rel="nofollow">Room McCoy</a> and <a href="http://stream.masterssystems.com:8000/opensuse3.ogv" rel="nofollow">Room Scotty</a>. Keep an eye on the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_video">wik page</a> as the team will add feeds to more rooms if we can get some more volunteers to help us out.

<h2>Round Table Sessions!</h2>
<p>We've mentioned the <a href="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org/futuremedia">special feature track 'Future Media'</a> already and we've got an extra bite for you all: the track will feature two round table discussions, one about the value of Free and Open for our Society and one about the practicalities of doing 'open' projects. Find more in the schedule: <a href="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org/schedule/#fmt-08">Why open matters</a> and <a href="http://bootstrapping-awesome.org/schedule/#fmt-09">How do you DO open?</a>.</p>

<h2>We need YOU!</h2>
<p>Despite all our work, this event would be nothing without YOUR help. We're still looking for <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_Teams">volunteers to sign up</a> but there's another thing we need you for: be pro-active and get the most out of this event! That means not only sitting in the talks but also stepping up and participating in the <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/10/03/osc-2012-bof-sessions-can-be-scheduled/">BoF Sessions</a>. And organize a BoF if you think there's something to discuss!</p>

<h2>Party time!</h2>
<p>Of course, we're also thinking about the social side of the event. Yes, there will surely be an extensive "hallway track" as we feature a nice area with booths and the university has lots of hallways... But sometimes it's just nice to sit down with someone over a good beer, and this is where our parties come in. As <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/10/16/linuxdays-parties-scheduled/">this article explains</a>, there will be two parties: one on Friday, as warming-up (and pre-registration), starting 6PM and one on Saturday, rockin' in the city center of Prague. Note that you will need your badge to enter this party, which means you <a href="http://conference.opensuse.org/Register/">have to be registered</a>!</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>
<p>As we <a href="http://news.opensuse.org/2012/10/15/announcing-opensuse-conference-2012-sponsors/">wrote a few days ago</a>, all this would not be possible without our sponsors, and we'd like to thank them A LOT for their support!</p>

<p>Big hugs to Platinum Sponsor SUSE, Gold Sponsor Aeroaccess, Silver Sponsor Google, Bronze Sponsor B1Systems, supporters ownCloud and Univention and of course our media partners LinuxMagazine and Root.cz. Last but not least, a big shout-out to the university which is providing this location to us!</p>

<h2>FaQ</h2>
<p>On a practical level, we also published our <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference/FAQ">Conference FAQ</a> answering a bunch of questions you might have about the event. If you weren't sure about someting, check it out!</p>

<h2>More</h2>
<p>There will be more news in the coming days, be sure to keep an eye on <a href="http://news.opensuse.org">news.opensuse.org</a> for articles leading up and of course during the event. As one teaser, we've got the Speedy Geeko and Lightning talks schedule coming soon!</p>

<h1>Be there!</h1>
<p>This year oSC12 will take place at the <a href="http://www.cvut.cz/en">Czech Technical University</a> in Prague. The campus is located in the Dejvice district and is next to an underground station that gets you directly to the historic city center - an opportunity you can't miss!</p>

<p>We expect to welcome about 400 Open Source developers, testers, usability experts, artists and professional attendees to the openSUSE conference, but we won't be alone: this year, we work together with the local LinuxDays, SUSE Labs and the Gentoo community, making one big, smashing event!</p>

<p>The entire combined conference is expected to attract well over 700 people. Admission to the openSUSE conference as well as LinuxDays, the SUSE Labs conference and the Gentoo miniconf is completely free. However for oSC a professional attendee ticket is available that offers some additional benefits.</p>

<p>The conference will start on October 20 and end on the 23rd. Be there!</p>
