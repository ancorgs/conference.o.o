On July 19, the openSUSE Community will flock to the land where 2500 years ago, Philosophers started the Age of Reason. Humbly standing on the shoulders of these giants, we'll work, enjoy the great climate and each other, developing the technology for the future of humankind. The Greek Philosophers were part of a revolution which changed the world. So are we, and thus, under the motto of <strong>"Power to the Geeko"</strong>, we will gather and work on our very own Free Software revolution! Today we're happy to let you know that we have a date, specific location, logo and theme today! Our web site is up as well and information is being added to it.

<h2>About the conference</h2>
From July 19 until July 22 2013, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>, the second largest city in Greece and home to no less than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site">15 UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>, will be host to the fifth openSUSE Conference. Hundreds of hackers from around the globe will come to the country where the modern Age of Reason started. In the place where over 2500 years ago great thinkers like Parmenides, Hippocrates and Socrates sat down and taught the art of logical and critical thinking, we'll now sit down and talk critically about logic and code. If you want to join us, discuss the mysteries of reality, existence, freedom and computer languages, work on the future of Free and Open Source Software, read on!

The slogan of the conference this year will be <strong>'Power to the Geeko'</strong>, as we'd like to emphasize the bottom-up nature of our Free Software movement (an excellent fit with the country where early democracies developed). As always, and the Greeks understand this, too, very well: fun is to be a part of it. Thessaloniki helps greatly with that as it features beautiful beaches and a lively night life as well as good food and drinks. We expect plenty of socializing between the technical sessions and code.

<h2>Website and call for help</h2>
We've set up our website which will be updated over the coming weeks. A call for papers and registration site are in the works, as is a sponsorship brochure and more. If you'd like to help us with the organisation, we'd be happy to have you! You can subscribe to our <a href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-conference/">mailing list</a> and introduce yourself during one of our IRC meetings (announced on the mailing list).

The Greek Philosophers were part of a revolution which changed the world. So are we, and thus, under the motto of <strong>"Power to the Geeko"</strong>, we will gather and work on our revolution. Lets get those gears spinning!

<strong>Power to the Geeko!</strong>
