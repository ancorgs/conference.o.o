<p>The openSUSE Conference and Summit are meant to be places for everyone to feel safe and included.
  <strong>We, as a community, value and respect people of all stripes</strong> - genders, orientations, races, abilities, shapes and sizes - 
  <strong>and will not tolerate vilification, abuse or harassment in any form</strong>.
  We appreciate that cultural differences may cause misunderstanding so we will try to clarify these and will
  attempt to smooth misunderstandings as they arise. But we also expect people to to not play dumb, and make an effort 
  to ensure a pleasant conference experience for everyone.</p>

<p> Conference participants behaving in ways that run counter to these principles risk being 
  denied entrance or being expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
    Event Speakers should be especially aware of these concerns.</p>

<p>Our complete Code of Conduct can be found at <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Conference_code_of_conduct">the openSUSE website</a>.</p>
