<h1>openSUSE Summit Call for Papers</h1>
<p>The openSUSE Summit team is now accepting session proposals for the openSUSE Summit.
  The proposal submission period ends on June 15, 2012 at midnight EDT. Final announcement of the program will occur on or before July 23, 2012. 
  If you have any questions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:summit-cfp@opensuse.org">summit-cfp@opensuse.org</a>!</p>

<p>The Summit aims to continue the tradition of a fun and exciting gathering.  We will attempt to deliver a bi-lingual event with some 
  sessions offered in English and some in Spanish.  We also want to make this as welcoming as possible by inviting other projects to 
  participate in the Summit.</p>

<h2>Tracks</h2>
<p>The openSUSE Summit will have 3 tracks as outlined below. Presentations, BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions, and work shops are expected 
  to align with the track topic.</p>

<p><strong>openSUSE Community</strong><br />
The openSUSE Community track provides information and discussion around the openSUSE community. Topics include but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Project governance and organization</li>
  <li>How can we improve and evolve as a growing community</li>
  <li>What is the task of an Ambassador</li>
  <li>How to get involved</li>
</ul></p>

<p><strong>openSUSE Tech</strong><br />
The openSUSE Tech track provides information, discussion, and hands on experience with the technology that makes openSUSE tick. Topics 
in this track include, but are not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>The openSUSE Factory development model</li>
  <li>Packaging hands on</li>
  <li>Wiki editing help</li>
  <li>What is OBS and how do I use it</li>
  <li>Tools of the trade of the Artwork team</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>open World</strong><br />
The open World track provides a platform to present your project, or listen to the interesting things our sponsors want to share. Topics 
in this track may cover demos and HowTos, FOSS project introductions, or other interesting topics from areas such as the "Maker movement". 
This is also the platform for cross-community collaboration with upstream or other Linux distributions.</p>

<h2>Fun</h2>
<p>The openSUSE Summit, by virtue of being an openSUSE event, has fun high on the agenda. Therefore, proposals that are "outside the box" of a 
  "regular" software focused conference are encouraged. <em>Collaboratively Building a Giant Paper Mache Geeko</em> has already been proposed 
  and rejected due to environmental concerns.</p>
