Github for the openSUSE Conference website. 
Check out the wiki to learn the setup of this instance on openSUSE 12.1 and commiting changes to the repo.

An how to on how to setup the instance is here - https://github.com/shayonj/openSUSE-Conference/wiki/How-to's .
But exclude the deployment part, I will do it for now. Untill we get the site(conference.o.o) up and running).
If you have have any questions, ping me @ shayonj on IRC or sj@opensuse.org
